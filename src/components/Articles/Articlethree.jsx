                    <p>In an unprecedented leap forward for investigative journalism (and potentially law enforcement), mind-reading journalist from REM News has uncovered the deepest, darkest secrets of the political elite. After a week of telepathically snooping through the minds of high-ranking officials, the journalist has released shocking data: 79% of politicians spend a disturbing amount of time daydreaming about committing fraud "for fun."</p>

<p>"It started as a harmless experiment," the journalist explains. "I wanted to see if politicians were really as corrupt as people think. Turns out, they’re worse—but in an oddly casual way. They don't just scheme for power or money. A huge chunk of them fantasize about fraud the way normal people think about quitting their job to open a beachside taco stand."</p>

<h2>THE WILD THOUGHTS OF THE POLITICAL ELITE</h2>

<p>Through deep mind-probing techniques (mostly just standing near them and concentrating really hard), the journalist compiled some of the most absurd, borderline comedic fraud fantasies:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>"What if I create a fake country and apply for UN funding?"</strong> - Thought by an unnamed world leader who was also mentally designing a flag for his imaginary nation.</li>
    <li><strong>"Could I legally marry myself for tax benefits?"</strong> - A governor who shall remain nameless, but whose wedding invitations are already mentally drafted.</li>
    <li><strong>"What if I start a pyramid scheme where the bottom tier is just <em>more</em> politicians?"</strong> - A mayor who had clearly been watching too many business guru YouTube videos.</li>
    <li><strong>"I bet if I sold bottled air from my home state, people would buy it."</strong> - A senator who apparently doesn’t realize that this already exists.</li>
</ul>

<h2>WHY FRAUD? WHY FUN?</h2>

<p>Experts in political psychology (who were NOT granted mind-reading powers, unlike the journalist) suggest that the high-pressure environment of governance, combined with the thrill of getting away with things, might make fraud fantasies <em>weirdly entertaining</em> for politicians.</p>

<p>"It’s like how normal people play video games where they rob banks or steal cars," says Dr. Linda Thoughtswell, a leading political behaviorist. "Except in this case, the ‘game’ is real life, and they occasionally <em>actually do it</em> instead of just imagining it."</p>

<h2>WHAT THIS MEANS FOR THE FUTURE</h2>

<p>With this groundbreaking revelation, the question remains: <em>Should we be concerned?</em> The answer, according to the journalist, is <em>yes and no.</em></p>

<p>"Sure, 79% of politicians are mentally sketchy," the journalist admits. "But if we arrested people for <em>thinking</em> about fraud, we’d have to start locking up people who imagine elaborate heist movies while doing their taxes. The real problem is the 21% who <strong>don’t</strong> think about fraud at all—what are they planning that’s <strong>worse</strong> than fraud?!"</p>

<p>In the meantime, the journalist has decided to continue his journalistic journey by reading the minds of corporate CEOs. Early findings suggest that 64% of them believe they could personally beat a horse in a foot race, and 42% have detailed escape plans in case they ever need to "disappear" for tax reasons.</p>

<p>Stay tuned for further shocking revelations in REM News, as soon as the journalist recovers from the absolute madness he has uncovered inside the minds of the world’s leaders.</p>
